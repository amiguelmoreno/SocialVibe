    "primer-parrafo": "If you're reading this, you probably already have a profile on Instagram, TikTok..., you upload content, and you know that you can make a lot of money with these platforms. Whether it's making a video dancing to your favorite song or showing what you've eaten today, any content has its audience, but not everyone knows how to reach that audience, and this audience rarely knows how to find you.",

    "segundo-parrafo": "At SocialVibe Agency, we help you direct your content in the right direction. We are a digital marketing agency specializing in social media management.",

    "tercer-parrafo": "The need to create SocialVibe Agency arises from seeing the large number of profiles that exist and need help. And also from doing something original, professional, and fun. Where we all win. Money. A lot."

    "primer-parrafo": "I know what you're thinking. The intention and the desire are there, but if you want to explode and reach the maximum audience, if you want to create a large community, have high income, if you really want to live on creating content, it's essential to delegate work.",

    "segundo-parrafo": "First, you'll have to know how to start. Anyone can create a profile and start uploading content, but knowing how to use your content and social media correctly to get known is another story, and we know how to do it.",

  "faq": {
    "titulo": "FAQ",
    "introduction": "These are some of the most common questions from our clients:",
    "preguntas": {
      "pregunta-1": "If we work together, what do I have to do?",
      "respuesta-1": "Simply create content and send it to your personal manager; he will do the rest. We have come to make the process easier for you with the best possible results.",
      "pregunta-2": "How much do you charge for your services?",
      "respuesta-2": "There is no fixed fee; it is a percentage of what your accounts generate per month, so we make sure that the profiles are in the best possible condition. If nothing is generated in a month, we don't charge anything, although we already take care of that not happening.",
      "pregunta-3": "What type of content do you work with?",
      "respuesta-3": "We are not ones to judge the content of our clients. You create, and we make it work.",
      "pregunta-4": "Do I have to have a minimum number of followers to work with you?",
      "respuesta-4": "No, in fact, we work with all kinds of profiles, whether you have just opened your account or already have a created community.",
      "pregunta-5": "How often do I have to pass content to my manager?",
      "respuesta-5": "You can do it as often as you want. However, we recommend 1 to 3 photos/videos daily for the best results. Remember that by leaving us the management of your profiles, you will have much more time to create content.",
      "pregunta-6": "Do photos and videos have to be professional?",
      "respuesta-6": "There are no quality standards. We recommend being creative and doing your best with your own means.",
      "pregunta-7": "How long does it take to see results?",
      "respuesta-7": "From our experience, about 2 months. That's why the first contract we sign has that duration.",
      "pregunta-8": "Can I really make a living from social media?",
      "respuesta-8": "Of course! Many influencers earn the same or even more than any conventional job, and in some cases, they reach stratospheric figures. However, you should know that 80% of social media profiles do not exceed $300 per month. This is the 80% that has not yet hired our services."
